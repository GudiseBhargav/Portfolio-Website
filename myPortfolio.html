                <h3>M.Tech Project</h3>
                <h4>Project Name: Verilog Implementation of Cannonical Huffman Encoder for High Speed Data Compression</h4>
                <h5>Software required: Xilinx Vivado, Quartus II</h5>
                <p>The project "Verilog Implementation of Canonical Huffman Encoder for High-Speed Data Compression" involves the design and implementation of a hardware-based Canonical Huffman Encoder using Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL).</p>
                <p>Huffman coding is a widely used algorithm for lossless data compression, particularly efficient for variable-length codes.
                In this specific project, the focus is on implementing the Canonical Huffman Encoder, which generates optimal prefix codes for variable-length symbols based on their frequencies in the input data. The term "canonical" refers to a specific form of Huffman codes that simplifies the decoding process, making it more straightforward and faster.</p>
                <p>The Verilog language is utilized to describe the hardware architecture of the Huffman Encoder, specifying the logic gates, flip-flops, and connections required for efficient encoding. The emphasis on "high-speed data compression" suggests that the implementation aims to achieve fast processing and compression rates, which is crucial in applications where real-time or high-throughput compression is essential.</p>
                <p>This project combines concepts from digital design, algorithms, and data compression to create a specialized hardware component capable of rapidly and effectively compressing data using the Canonical Huffman coding technique. The outcome is expected to be a hardware module suitable for integration into systems where high-speed data compression is a critical requirement, such as in communication systems or data storage devices.</p></p>

                <h3>B.Tech Project</h3>
                <h4>Project Name: Classification of breast cancer mammogram images using convolution neural network.</h4>
                <h5>Framework required: TensorFlow</h5></baru>
                <p>The project on the "Classification of Breast Cancer Mammogram Images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)" focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to automatically classify mammogram images as indicative of either malignant or benign cases of breast cancer. Mammography is a crucial tool in breast cancer screening, and automating the classification process through CNNs can assist in improving efficiency and accuracy.</p>
                <p>The Convolutional Neural Network architecture is chosen due to its proven effectiveness in image classification tasks. CNNs are capable of automatically learning relevant hierarchical features from images, making them well-suited for tasks like medical image analysis. In the context of breast cancer classification, the CNN is trained on a dataset of mammogram images with associated labels indicating whether the cases are malignant or benign.</p>
                <p>During the training phase, the CNN learns to extract meaningful features from mammogram images that are indicative of the presence of cancerous abnormalities. The model is then fine-tuned through an iterative process to enhance its accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign instances. The performance of the trained CNN is evaluated on a separate set of mammogram images not used during training, providing insights into its generalization capabilities.</p>
                <p>The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a reliable and efficient tool for automated breast cancer classification, assisting healthcare professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer from mammogram images. This can potentially contribute to improving patient outcomes by facilitating timely interventions and treatments. Additionally, the project aligns with the broader trend of leveraging artificial intelligence in healthcare for more accurate and expedited medical diagnostics.</p></p>
